    "worstPart": "While learning new tech is always cool, learning how to make my own webpack was not as cool. The school that I attend has their own generic Webpack file you can use for projects. I tried to copy their webpack and figured 'this will definitely work'. It did not definitely work. After 2 days of trouble shooting (between school and being a human), I realized that I was running Webpack 5 and the school was utilizing Webpack 4. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Note to self: always check your versions and always read the docs."

    "favoritePart": "This was the second time I built this project. Definitely way smoother the second time around, and I even had time to complete the extension, which was my favorite part. The extension I built was returing the time it took to complete the game. It was heavy on logic, which is one of my favorite (most days) parts about coding.",
